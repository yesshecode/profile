		<h4 class="title-about title"> About me </h4>
		<p class="first-paragraph paragraph">I was born and raised in Brazil but have been calling Canada home since 2013. I have a bachelors degree in business and am a certified professional project manager (PMI) since 2011. <br><br> I have managed projects accross different industries since the beginning of my career in 2006. It was a long journey… I worked in  research & development, mining, oil & gas, then I landed a job in IT as a project manager for web/software development. I finally found home! Here is where my passion for web development begins.</p>
			
			
		<p class="second-paragraph paragraph">While managing projects I learnt how to  design and build beautiful and responsive websites and have been building custom websites for clients around the world, in both english and portuguese. <br> <br> I love dogs, but don’t have one. I learnt english as an adult and have been diving deep into self-development. If you want to know more about me, check my blog or let’s have a coffee!</p>
